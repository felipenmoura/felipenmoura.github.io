            <article itemprop="articleBody"><strong>About the conference</strong>
This year I had the honor of being part of the Mozilla Summit, a really, REALY great meeting with some of the brightest minds at Mozilla(and in the world). Some really cool aspects were discussed about Mozilla and it's future and plans. Also, there were inspiring talks about Mozilla's history and conquers.

<strong>About the sessions</strong>
One other interesting thing I noticed in the conference was that I could attend some talks related to <em>social psycology</em>, <em>laws/politics</em>, <em>market/stocks</em>, <em>story</em>, <em>motivation</em> and of course, <em>technology</em>...this is pretty interesting to see in such a conference!
Also, the sessions were way different than what we are used to! With some social interactions, games, group dynamics, meetings, and others.
This means that each and every room had creative people, interested on discussing and participating, and also, giving something useful back to Mozilla, results, ideas, feedback, etc! Epic win!
<blockquote>In a conference in an hotel, one guy said:
<em>You want what, a microchip in each doorknob?</em>
Ten years later, in the same hotel, they gave him a card instead of a key...there was a microchip on each doorknob in the hotel.</blockquote>
<strong>About the attendees</strong>
What about it? Mozilla Summit 2013 happened simultaneously in 3 different countries, summing 1800 attendees!
In Toronto, there were about 600 people.

<strong>New MDN</strong>
So, we can now test the new MDN interfaces, and guys, it's really cool!
The new MDN manager now is based on an useful API, which allows us to use it to list our demos or articles anywhere we want, for example!

<strong>About Toronto, the trip, the Hotel and the parties</strong>
Toronto is a fantastic city! It's really impressive to see how good is the traffic, and the details of the city!
The architecture is beautiful and you can see that even the old buildings are quite in good condition! They pay good attention to the details! The street asphalt is perfectly smooth, you see absolutely no dogs on the streets and I could count on my fingers the number of homeless I could see!
By the way, the "street hot dogs" are really good and cheap there!
People in Toronto are very, VERY polite! The world I most heard was, for sure, "sorry"!

The bars and pubs were really cool too, their beer is strong and the food very spicy, I think it's because of their winter.
The flight from Porto Alegre up to Toronto is tiring, indeed(about 14 hours long) but totally worth it!

It was a pleasure to re-meet with people I haven't seen for a while, meet new people, see "monsters" of technology talking...it was an awesome moment! Thank you Mozilla for such opportunity, and thank you mozillians for being such awesome people! :)

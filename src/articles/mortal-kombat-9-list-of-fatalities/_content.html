Hope this can help you!

By the way, every time you finish the game(in arcade mode) and earn something, go to the crypt to claim for it choosing the character you used to finish the game at last.
To choose an alternative costume, when you earn a new cloth, use the START button when selecting the character, instead of any other button ;)

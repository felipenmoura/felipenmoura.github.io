With a palette image we try to allocate a new color, if that\n    failed, we choose the closest (in theory) computed color.  This is\n    not always the closest visual color. That may produce a weird result, like\n    blank (or visually blank) images.  To skip this problem, please use a\n    truecolor image as a destination image, such as one created by\n    imagecreatetruecolor."}],"changelog":[],"seealso":[]}

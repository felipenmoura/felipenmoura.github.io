This is\n        a short, usually less than 16 character \"handle\" of the\n        user, not the real, full name. This should be the same as\n        the username parameter used when\n        calling the function, and hence redundant.\n       \n      \n      \n       passwd\n       \n        The passwd element contains the user's password in an\n        encrypted format.

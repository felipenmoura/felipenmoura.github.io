Let me sail, let me sail,<br>
let the Orinoco Flow,<br>
let me reach, let me beach<br>
on the shores of Tripoli.<br>
Let me sail, let me sail,<br>
let me crash upon your shore,<br>
let me reach, let me beach<br>
far beyond the Yellow Sea.<p>

De, de<br>
de, de<br>
de, de<br>
de, de<br>
de, de<p>

Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<p>

From Bissau to Palau - in the shade of Avalon,<br>
from Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony,<br>
from Peru to Cebu hear the power of Babylon,<br>
from Bali to Cali - far beneath the Coral Sea.<p>

De, de<br>
de, de<br>
de, de<br>
de, de<br>
de, de<p>

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu. Ooh.<br>
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu. Ooh.<br>
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, adieu. Aah...<p>

Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<p>

From the North to the South, Ebudæ into Khartoum,<br>
from the deep sea of Clouds to the island of the moon,<br>
carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been,<br>
carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen.<br>
We can sail, we can sail on the Orinoco Flow,<br>
we can sail, we can sail.<br>
(sail away, sail away, sail away)<p>

We can steer, we can near<br>
with Rob Dickins at the wheel,<br>
we can sigh, say goodbye Ross and his dependencies<br>
we can sail, we can sail<br>
(sail away, sail away, sail away)<p>

We can sail, we can sail.<p>

Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.<br>
Sail away, sail away, sail away.

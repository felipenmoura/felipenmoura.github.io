## Test your Markup

Test your Markup is a game which will challange you to remember and type a number of related words.  
You can try it out using the name of countries or, if you are a web developer, HTML tags and JavaScript tools, libraries and frameworks.

Seens easy? Well, it might be harder than you think!  
If you got to the end of the game, tweet a print of it mentioning @felipenmoura :)

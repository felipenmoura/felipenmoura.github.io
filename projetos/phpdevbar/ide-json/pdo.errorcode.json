Briefly, an SQLSTATE consists of a\n   two characters class value followed by a three characters subclass value. A\n   class value of 01 indicates a warning and is accompanied by a return code\n   of SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO. Class values other than '01', except for the\n   class 'IM', indicate an error.  The class 'IM' is specific to warnings\n   and errors that derive from the implementation of PDO (or perhaps ODBC,\n   if you're using the ODBC driver) itself.  The subclass value '000' in any\n   class indicates that there is no subclass for that SQLSTATE.PDO::errorCode only retrieves error codes for operations\n   performed directly on the database handle. If you create a PDOStatement\n   object through PDO::prepare or\n   PDO::query and invoke an error on the statement\n   handle, PDO::errorCode will not reflect that error.\n   You must call PDOStatement::errorCode to return the error\n   code for an operation performed on a particular statement handle.Returns NULL if no operation has been run on the database handle."},"errors":null,"notes":[],"changelog":[],"seealso":[{"type":"function","name":"PDO::errorInfo"},{"type":"function","name":"PDOStatement::errorCode"},{"type":"function","name":"PDOStatement::errorInfo"}]}

The return value can be compared\n   to one of the VT_XXX constants.The return value for COM and DOTNET objects will usually be\n   VT_DISPATCH; the only reason this function works for\n   those classes is because COM and DOTNET are descendants of VARIANT.In PHP versions prior to 5, you could obtain this information from\n   instances of the VARIANT class ONLY, by reading a fake\n   type property.  See the  class for more information on\n   this."},"errors":null,"notes":[],"changelog":[],"seealso":[]}

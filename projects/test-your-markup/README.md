## Test your Markup

Test your Markup is a game which will challange you to remember and type a number of related words.  
You can try it out using the name of countries or, if you are a web developer, HTML tags and JavaScript tools, libraries and frameworks.

Seens easy? Well, it might be harder than you think!  
If you got to the end of the game, tweet a print of it mentioning [@felipenmoura](https://twitter.com/felipenmoura) with the _hashtag_ `#flowless` :)

## Help wanted

This is a game I made in my (almost null) free time, and I know it has lots of improvements to be made.  
It would be awesome if you could help with:

- adding sounds and background song
- adding more options/lists
- keeping updated the lists that exist there (send suggestions, as well)
- better design/images/colors/fonts
- reporting bugs and sending feedback :)
